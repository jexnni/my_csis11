2. Make changes such that the COUNT is #10 (decimal 10)
3. What are the numbers shown in the console?

4. What is the **first** character and why isn't it decimal 10?

```lc3

; 3. :987654321Halting computer

; 4. In hex, there is no 10 value, the ascii is assigned the ':' colon character

        .ORIG x3000     ; start of code
        LD R1, VALUE    ; load the value to shift into R1
        LD R2, COUNT    ; load counter value in to R2
        LD R3, ASCII    ; load the ASCII increment into R3

SHIFT   ADD R1, R1, R1  ; shift the value left
        ADD R0, R2, R3  ; convert COUNT to ASCII
        OUT             ; output the COUNT ASCII value
        ADD R2, R2, #-1 ; decrement COUNT
        BRp SHIFT       ; continue until counter goes to 0

        HALT            ; stop the program
VALUE   .FILL x0A0A     ; value to shift
COUNT   .FILL #10        ; number of shifts (n, n-1, n-2, ... 1)
ASCII   .FILL x0030     ; increment for making a number, ASCII
        .END            ; end of source code

```


#### addnums.asm
1. Copy the file from the instructor/week_6 to your week_6 folder
2. Change the file such that the **final sum is x0085 (the original sum is 55)**
2. Run in the simulator and provide a screenshot showing the result when the program has finished.

#### addnums.asm -> subnums.asm
1. Copy the file from the instructor/week_6 to your week_6 folder
2. Change the file such that the values are **subtracted**, instead of added
2. Paste the complete code here, in between the code fences
```lc3

.ORIG x3000            ; start of code
        AND R1, R1, x0 ; clear R1, running sum
        AND R4, R4, x0 ; clear R4, counter
        LD  R4, N_DATA ; load R4 with number of data points
        LEA R2, DATA   ; load the starting address of the data

LOOP    LDR R3, R2, x0 ; load the next number to be added
        ADD R2, R2, #-1 ; increment the pointer
        ADD R1, R1, R3 ; add the next number to the running sum
        ADD R4, R4, #-1 ; decrement the counter
        BRp LOOP       ; do it again if the counter is not yet zero
        HALT           ; halt

N_DATA  .FILL x0A      ; number of data elements
DATA    .FILL x01      ; first data element
        .FILL x02    
        .FILL x03    
        .FILL x04    
        .FILL x05    
        .FILL x06    
        .FILL x07    
        .FILL x08    
        .FILL x09 
        .FILL x0A   
        .END

```
 
## 6b - Explore how to use data

### Objectives
1. Learn how to specify data in assembly
2. Learn how to use data in coding
3. Learn the limits of data locations

### Assignment

For each exercise, please do the following:
- Write complete, working LC-3 assembly code
- Include comments explaining your approach
- Test your code in the LC-3 simulator
- Document how they handled memory constraints and register usage
- **Provide your code developed, in code fences, after each assignment.**

1. **Variable Declaration and Access**
   Write LC-3 assembly code to:
   - Declare a variable named ```COUNT``` with initial value 5
   - Increment it by 1
   - Store the result back in ```COUNT```

```lc3

        .ORIG x3000     ; start program
        LD R1, COUNT    ; load count into R1
        ADD R1, R1, #1  ; increment by 1
        ST R1, COUNT    ; store back into count

EXIT    HALT            ; stop the program
COUNT   .FILL #5        ; count starts at 5
        .END            ; end of source code


```

2. **Case Sensitivity Practice**
   Determine if these labels refer to the same variable:
   ```assembly
   TOTAL   .FILL   #10
   total   .FILL   #20
   Total   .FILL   #30
   ```
   Explain your answer.

```lc3

; Yes, because all the registers loaded 'Total', or the most recent .FILL

        .ORIG x3000     ; start program
        LD R1, TOTAL    ; load count into R1
        LD R2, total    ; load count into R2        
        LD R3, Total    ; load count into R3
                        ; the registers all correspond to their .FILL
                        

EXIT    HALT            ; stop the program
TOTAL   .FILL   #10
total   .FILL   #20
Total   .FILL   #30     
        .END            ; end of source code


```

3. **Pointer Usage**
   Write code to:
   - Create a pointer variable ```PTR``` that points to a value
   - Use LDI to load the value it points to into R1
   - Use STI to store a new value through the pointer

```lc3

        .ORIG x3000     ; start
        LD R1, PTR      ; R1 has PTR
        LDI R2, PTR     ; R2 points to where PTR, R1
        ADD R2, R2, #1  ; increment R2
        STI R2, PTR     ; store R2 in PTR

        HALT

PTR     .FILL x3100
VALUE   .FILL #10

        .END

```

## Simple Math Calculator

### Part 1 - Add and Subtract

1. Create a new folder in your student folder called SMC.
2. Add a file called add_sub.asm
3. Write the code which will add and subtract 2 numbers. Be sure to label your variables so they are easy to reference.
4. Use a ASCII "+" to determine if you add and an ASCII "-", for subtraction, think of it from a "conditional" perspective.

```lc3

        .ORIG x3000     ; start
        LD R0, VALUE1
        LD R1, VALUE2

        LD R2, PLUS
        LD R3, MINUS

        LD R4, SUM
        LD R5, DIFF

;Addition
        ADD R2, R0, R1  ; Add R0 and R1
        ST R4, SUM

;Subtration

        NOT R1, R1      ; take not of R1
        ADD R1, R1, #1  ; two's complement by add +1
        ADD R3, R0, R1  ; Add R0 and two's complement R1
        ST R5, DIFF

        HALT


PLUS    .FILL #43
MINUS   .FILL #45
VALUE1  .FILL #10
VALUE2  .FILL #5
SUM     .FILL x0
DIFF    .FILL x0
        .END

```
